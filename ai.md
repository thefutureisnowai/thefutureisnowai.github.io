AI and Data </strong></summary>

AI can streamline your business by improving workflow, increasing worker productivity, answering questions about your business or promoting your business, automating scheduling and other repetitive tasks, impressing your customers, and ultimately generating more revenue for your business. AI and other statistical techniques can provide data-driven insights, and help you make decisions with cost-benefit analysis. You may have various forms of business data, in various formats, on various devices. We can bring all your data together, and make it work for you. Whatever your AI or data-related needs, we have you covered.

LLMs (Large Language Models), ChatBots</strong></summary>

LLMs are a type of generative language model with various numerous use-cases, including chatbots. LLMs draw on machine learning techniques to learn statistical patterns in text, and require immense amounts of data and power to learn. Thus, in most applications leaning on existing LLMs is more practical than creating new ones. We can engineer software for you, to integrate AI into your unique workflow.
<br><br>
We can make a custom chatbot for your website with a unique personality, knowledge, and instructions suited to your needs. The chatbot will be able to engage with customers who visit your website, and answer questions about your business. There are numerous other chatbot applications which we can build for whatever use-case you have.
<br><br>
Beyond website integration, LLMs have a wide array of uses for improving productivity, such as automating repetitive tasks, keeping workers on track, writing simple code snippets, searching large texts, and much more. We can write you custom software with embedded AI, to integrate into and enhance your workflow.
<br><br>
Though in most cases utilizing the API of an existing LLM is the most practical and cost-effective way to integrate LLMs into your workflow, it is not ideal for every scenario. In unique applications, we can fine-tune AI to your specialized need. This is especially useful if you have data that is relevant to the task you are trying to solve with AI.
<br><br>
In very specific scenarios, it may be useful to build an entirely new LLM. We can design a completely unique LLM model for you, or re-purpose an open-source model. This would allow you to have a more specialized design which you're in complete control of. We could host it on the cloud, or at your business. This approach is much more involved and costly than the products above.

Control and Decision Algorithms / Automation </strong></summary>
Although LLMs can be used to some extent for control and decision tasks, that is not what they're designed for. For specialized tasks we have better suited techniques (such as deep reinforcement learning) which are more efficient, consistent, and accurate. In some cases, we can achieve perfect or near-perfect control results, especially in cases where the possible control actions / decisions and possible outcomes are known in advance. We also have techniques for handling more dynamic problems with an unknown or changing state/action space.
<br><br>
In this context, the difference between control and decision is somewhat thin. Control tasks tend to be ongoing and continuous, with well defined control actions, such as driving a car or mixing paint. Decision tasks are usually discrete, where you have a number of options to choose from and you do this once every so often.
<br><br>
Using these elegant methods for control, we can utilize prior knowledge and draw on your experience to guide AI, making actions consistent and reliable. We can pool together all your data from various sources, and utilize it to help you make informed decisions and increase revenue. For example:
<br><br>
Weighted risk (cost/benefit analysis): Utilize your data to make decisions which statistically minimize risk and maximize profit.
<br><br>
Other algorithms we offer services in include: deep reinforcement learning, rule-based methods, decision trees, random forests, linear / non-linear programming, dynamic programming, genetic programming...
