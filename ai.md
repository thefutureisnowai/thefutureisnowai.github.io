## AI and Data
<br>
<div class="left-align">
AI can streamline your business by: improving workflow, increasing worker productivity, answering questions about and promoting your business, automating scheduling, impressing your customers, and ultimately generating revenue for your business. AI and other statistical techniques can provide data-driven insights, and help you make decisions with cost-benefit analysis. You may have various forms of business data, in various formats, on various devices. We can bring all your data together, and make it work for you. Whatever your AI or data-related needs, we have you covered.

The owner of Secure Computer Solutions, <a href="https://sethbriney.com/ai">Seth L. Briney</a>, is an AI expert, having earned two master's degrees largely focused on AI (in mathematics and computer science). Seth has experience in various AI projects, notably applying deep learning, reinforcement learning control, and utilizing existing LLM (Large Language Model) API (Application Programming Interface) in web development. More details can be found on Seth's website.

LLMs (Large Language Models), ChatBots
</strong></summary>
<br>
LLMs are a type of generative language model with various numerous use-cases, including chatbots. LLMs draw on machine learning techniques to learn statistical patterns in text, and require immense amounts of data and power to learn. Thus, in most applications leaning on existing LLMs is the most practical, though often does require some engineering. For LLM services, assume we are talking about using the API (Application Programming Interface) of an existing LLM (not creating one from scratch), unless otherwise specified.
<br><br>
We can make a custom chatbot for your website with a unique personality suited to your needs, utilizing. You can provide us information about your business you'd like your chatbot to have access to, and it can answer questions about your business within the guidelines you specify. Using these techniques we can provide guidelines for how the bot should act (specifying the kind of things you want it to say, or don't want it to say), make it more concise, more consistent, or even more creative.
<br><br>
Beyond website integration, LLMs have a wide array of uses for improving productivity, such as automating repetitive tasks, keeping workers on track, writing simple code snippets, searching large texts, and much more. We can write you custom software with embedded AI, to integrate into and enhance your workflow.
<br><br>
Though in most cases utilizing the API of an existing LLM is the most practical and cost-effective way to integrate LLMs into your workflow, it is not ideal for every scenario. In unique applications, we can fine-tune AI to your specialized need. This is especially useful if you have data that is relevant to the task you are trying to solve with AI. Even if your data is inconsistently formatted we can still use it, which allows combine datasets in ways that would otherwise require a lot of cleaning and data-engineering.
<br><br>
In some cases even fine-tuning may not be adequate. In this case we can design a completely unique LLM model for you, or re-purpose an open-source model. This would allow you to have a more specialized design which you're in complete control of. We could host it on the cloud, or even at your business so you don't have to rely on a third-party entity. This approach is more involved and costly.

 Control and Decision Algorithms / Automation
</strong></summary>
    <br>
Although LLMs can be used to some extent for control and decision tasks, that is not what they're designed for. For specialized tasks we have better suited techniques (such as deep reinforcement learning) which are more efficient, consistent, and accurate. In some cases, we can achieve perfect or near-perfect control results, especially in cases where the possible control actions / decisions and possible outcomes are known in advance. We also have techniques for handling more dynamic problems with an unknown or changing state/action space.
<br><br>
In this context, the difference between control and decision is somewhat thin. Control tasks tend to be ongoing and continuous, with well defined control actions, such as driving a car or mixing paint. Decision tasks are usually discrete, where you have a number of options to choose from and you do this once every so often. These are not hard definitions, they're just here to build some intuition. Every real-world problem is unique, and there's no need to bin everything into one of two categories. The following control theories have many similarities: Reinforcement Learning (RL), Bayesian Decision Theory (BDT), Markov Decision Processes (MDP), and Model Predictive Control (MPC).
<br><br>
In all of these theories there exists some sort of observation or state, and some number (possibly infinite) of possible actions. Each algorithm has its own intricacies and subtleties, and different variants (hidden, partially observed, stochastic, ...). We would be happy to go over more details with you during a consultation. We have knowledge and experience in all these algorithms, and offer services which utilize them including: software development, remote control, and consulting. This is a complex space, and it's impossible to cover every detail, so please reach out if you are interested.
<br><br>
Using these elegant methods for control, we can utilize prior knowledge and draw on your experience to guide an AI, making actions consistent and reliable. We can pool together all your data from various sources, and utilize it to help you make informed decisions and increase revenue. For example:
<br><br>
Weighted risk (cost/benefit analysis): Utilize your data to make decisions which statistically minimize risk and maximize profit.
<br><br>
Other algorithms we offer services in include: deep reinforcement learning, rule-based methods, decision trees, random forests, linear / non-linear programming, dynamic programming, genetic programming, ... .
<br><br>
We are familiar with a large number of algorithms relevant to decision making and control, so if you're unsure if we can help you, please reach out. The methods in this section are far more consistent and efficient than LLMs: they require less data, less power, and less compute resources. In some cases, they don't even require a GPU.
