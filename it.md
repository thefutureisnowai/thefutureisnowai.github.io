    <h2>Photo Scraping & Device Consolidation</h2>
  </div>

  <details class="main-deets">
    <summary class="main-summary"><strong>Recover photos and videos from old or failing devices</strong></summary>
    <br>

    We recover and consolidate photos and videos from a wide range of devices — old laptops, desktops, failing hard drives, USB sticks, phones, tablets, and even systems that no longer boot. Our process includes making a complete, sector-level backup to a customer-provided external SSD, ensuring your data stays safe throughout the entire job.
    <br><br>

    After imaging each device, we perform an exceptionally thorough search for photos, videos, and other media across the full backup: user folders, caches, system files, hidden directories, email stores, and any location where memories may be buried. This level of extraction goes well beyond standard tools and often recovers items long thought lost.
    <br><br>

    If you have multiple aging devices or disorganized storage, we can bring everything together into one clear, accessible archive of your important memories.

    <h2>Professional Business IT</h2>
  </div>

  <details class="main-deets">
    <summary class="main-summary"><strong>Engineering-focused solutions for specialized business needs</strong></summary>
    <br>

    We assist businesses with technical projects that require careful engineering rather than conventional IT management. This includes designing systems for unusual workflows, building custom tools when no existing solution fits, and working through technical challenges that demand a deeper and more methodical approach.
    <br><br>

    <strong>Atypical Networking & End-to-End Security</strong><br>
    We design networking and communication setups for environments where trust cannot be assumed. This includes situations with unusual constraints, mixed equipment, legacy hardware, or infrastructure that must be secured end-to-end. When data integrity and reliability are essential, we engineer paths that remain stable and predictable under real-world conditions.
    <br><br>

    <strong>Reducing Reliance on Large Vendors</strong><br>
    When appropriate, we introduce open or independent technologies to give businesses more control over their systems and reduce their dependence on large commercial ecosystems. The goal is reliability and trust—systems that behave consistently and are not subject to changing policies, licenses, or external decisions.
    <br><br>

    <strong>Custom Software & Integration</strong><br>
    When off-the-shelf software cannot handle a specific workflow, we design small, focused tools or integrations that address the exact requirement. These solutions are engineered for clarity, reliability, and long-term stability rather than feature bloat or complexity.
    <br><br>

    <strong>Engineering Mindset</strong><br>
    Our approach is rooted in scientific thinking and systematic analysis. We work to understand each problem fully, design solutions that remain dependable under stress, and build systems that can be trusted to behave consistently over time.
