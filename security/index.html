	We look forward to providing you with secure solutions, but since we care deeply about your security, here are a few pieces of advice in the meantime. Don't worry if you don't understand everything. It's a lot to take in. We will be happy to explain anything of it, or directly help you implement these best security practices:<br>
<br>
- Verify Programs: Don't run anything you don't trust. Be extremely cautious about running programs you download off the internet. Some vendors provide cryptographic verification (many package managers will perform verification automatically), and if they don't, you should be very cautious about running their software. Check URLs, make sure they start with https://, and NOT http://, as http connections are not secure (the s DOES stand for secure). Cross reference the website, read reviews, download from multiple sources and compare cryptographic hashes (sha256sum, for example), ... If you need help, don't hesitate to reach out to us.<br>
<br>
- Updates: Keeping up with security updates is important. Please check for and install security updates at least weekly, but preferrably, every time you use your computer. Vulnerabilities can be rapidly discovered and patched.<br>
<br>
- Power Off / Disconnect the Internet: Some malicious software can run in the background, and even wait until your computer is inactive to kick in. Disconnecting the internet every time you step away from your computer will reduce the chance of being hacked, or data leakage. Powering off you computer can reset bugs, and will stop some malicious software in its tracks. If you believe your computer has been infected, your first step should be to disconnect the internet as soon as possible, then power your computer down, and contact us for a malware / virus removal service.<br>
<br>
- Virus Software: It is a good idea to regularly scan your computer for viruses, and to use real-time detection services. If you use Windows, you can use Windows Defender for free, which isn't a bad choice. There are plenty of other paid options to consider, and we encourage you to research various options, and of course, you can always reach out to us for advice or installation. Avoiding viruses in the first place should be the goal though, since no virus removal program is perfect.<br>
<br>
- Avoid http: Enable https only in your browser. If your browser does not have https only, use a different browser. If you must use http, only do so through a VPN, and verify anything you download. Downloading things through http is very dangerous, though if you can verify the download through cryptographic hashes, this mitigates the risk, and using a VPN makes it harder for a malicious agent to single you out.<br>
<br>
- Run your Browser in Private / Incognito mode when possible: If whatever you are doing does not require logging in, then there's no reason to drag cookies around. Typically in private / incognito mode, browsers will erase all cookies and cache when closed, which can even improve internet stability. This does not make you completely anonymous by itself, but it will reduce tracking, and it will reduce the chance of data leakage. You can have a private window open at the same time as a regular window, so keep your main logins in a regular window, and use a private window for things which don't require logging in, or even to separate different logins.<br>
<br>
- Use a VPN: No matter what you are doing, if you can use a VPN you probably should. Many VPNs carry only a minimal internet speed performance drop (and in some cases can even improve speeds). Using a VPN will make it harder for hackers to target you and steal your data. It will make it harder for companies to profile you. It will hide your activity from your Internet Service Provider. Many VPN providers even offer real-time malware protection and ad-blocking. Ad-blocking is also a good idea, as it will improve performance, and can even stop some malware and tracking. Let us know if you want advice on which VPN to choose, or if you need help installing it. Be cautious, as many scammers will masquerade as VPN providers, so when in doubt, contact Secure Computer Solutions.
