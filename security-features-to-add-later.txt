on server (when migrate to server I have control over)
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://securecomputer.ai

HTTP Headers: When you move to a host that allows more control over HTTP headers, ensure these policies are set server-side for better security enforcement.

Add Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) once moved to a self-controlled server.
Set Access-Control-Allow-Origin only if serving API resources externally.
Consider Jekyll or other static site generators for easier updates.
