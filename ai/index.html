	    <h2>AI and Data</h2>
	    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		AI can streamline your business by: improving workflow, increasing worker productivity, answering questions about and promoting your business, automating scheduling, impressing your customers, and ultimately generating revenue for your business. AI and other statistical techniques can provide data-driven insights, and help you make decisions with cost-benefit analysis. You may have various forms of business data, in various formats, on various devices. We can bring all your data together, and make it work for you. Whatever your AI or data-related needs, we have you covered.<br>
<br>The owner of Secure Computer Solutions, <a href="https://sethbriney.com/">Seth L. Briney</a>, is an AI expert, having earned two master's degrees largely focused on AI (in mathematics and computer science). Seth has experience in various AI projects, notably applying deep learning, reinforcement learning control, and utilizing existing LLM (Large Language Model) API (Application Programming Interface) in web development. More details can be found on Seth's website.<br>
<br>
<br>
AI / data services we offer include:<br>
<br>
<b>- LLMs: (Large Language Models)</b><br>
<br>
LLMs are a very popular type of AI with numerous use-cases, made famous by OpenAI's ChatGPT. In fact, they are often used synonymously with AI, though AI is a much broader field. LLMs draw on machine learning techniques to learn statistical patterns in text, and require immense amounts of data and power to learn. Thus, in most applications leaning on existing LLMs (such as ChatGPT) is the most practical, though often does require some engineering. In the following services, assume we are talking about using the API (Application Programming Interface) of an existing LLM (not creating one from scratch), unless otherwise specified.<br>
<br>
We can make a custom chatbot on your website with a unique personality suited to your needs, utilizing techniques such as prompt-engineering, document retrieval, and function calling in addition to tweaking parameters such as <i>heat</i> and <i>max-tokens</i>. You can provide us information about your business you'd like your chatbot to have access to, and it can answer questions about your business within the guidelines you specify. Using these techniques we can provide guidelines for how the bot should act (specifying the kind of things we want it to say, or that we don't want it to say), make it more concise, more consistent, or even more creative. It can even automate other parts of your website, email you, schedule appointments, and much more.<br>
<br>
LLMs carry risks, such as the potential for inappropriate or repetitive responses, or referring potential clients to your competitors. If not implemented correctly, a chatbot interface can be abused and end up costing a lot of money in API calls. We have custom software and other tools for handling these risks.<br>
<br>
Beyond website integration, LLMs (Large Language Models) have a wide array of uses for improving productivity, such as automating repetitive tasks, keeping workers on track, and much more. We can write you custom software integrated with AI to integrate into and enhance your workflow.<br>
<br>
Though in most cases utilizing the API of an existing LLM is the most practical and cost-effective way to integrate LLMs into your workflow, it is not ideal for every use-case. In unique applications sometimes fine-tuning on a custom dataset may be enough, though you might want even more control. In this case we can design a completely unique model for you, or re-purpose an open-source model. This would allow you to have a more specialized design which you're in complete control of. We could host it on the cloud, or even at your business so you don't have to rely on a third-party entity. This approach is more involved, but we can handle it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>- Control and Decision Tasks:</b><br>
<br>
Although LLMs can be used to some extent for control tasks, they can be inconsistent, overly complex, and wasteful. Particularly in cases where your control actions are well defined, other AI methods are usually preferable. AI methods for control include: reinforcement learning, Bayesian decision theory, rule-based methods, and decision trees. These methods are far more consistent and efficient than LLMs: they require less data, less power, and less compute resources. In some cases, they don't even require a GPU.<br>
<br>
Using these more elegant methods for control, we can utilize prior knowledge and draw on your experience to guide an AI, making actions consistent and reliable. We can pool together all your data from various sources, and utilize it to help you make informed decisions and increase revenue. Applications include:<br>
<br>
Weighted risk (cost/benefit analysis): Utilize your data to make decisions which minimize risk and maximize profit.
<br>
- Prediction / Forecasting: Utilizing deep learning and other statistical prediction methods, we create tools for you to make data-driven predictions.<br>
<br>
