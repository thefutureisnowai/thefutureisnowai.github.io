  <summary class="main-summary"> Avoid http: Use https </summary>
  Most browsers have an indicator immediately to the left of the address bar which tells you if a page is using http or https. Using http is not secure, and can leave you vulnerable to data-theft, man-in-the-middle attacks, and other cyber attacks. On the other hand, https is encrypted which makes it far less vulnerable.
