<h2>Contact Us</h2>

In situations where confidentiality is important, or if sensitive information is involved, we recommend using Signal messenger to contact us at our cell number, +1 360-230-8257. Signal is third party application, NOT affiliated with Secure Computer Solutions. We have provided the external link below. This domain is NOT controlled by Secure Computer Solutions.<br>
<br>
In order to use Signal, you must register your Signal account with a phone number, which can be a digital text-only phone number (for example, you can get a free one through Google Voice), in case you do not want to expose your real phone number. Whatever service provider you use will only know that you registered the number with Signal, and will not have access to your Signal texts or calls, which are encrypted end-to-end. So in theory, only you and the recipient can access your correspondence. Avoiding using your real phone number carries a number of benefits, including guarding against SIM-swap and SPAM (though of course WE will not share your phone number with any third parties, nor will we use it for marketing or any purpose which falls outside the necessity of providing you the service you request).<br>
<br>
Proton Mail to Proton Mail emails are also encrypted end-to-end, so (in theory) only you and the recipient can read them, but you must use a Proton Mail account for all the features to work. If you want a private email option, you can reach us at help@tfin.ai, which is hosted by Proton Mail, and we suggest using a protonmail account for this (link below), to ensure that emails are encrypted, so that (in theory) not even Proton Mail employees can access the emails.<br>
<br>
You are welcome to use any other methods of contacting us if you are not concerned about other entities having access to our communication. You should generally be cautious about what information you send over the internet, anyway.<br>
<br>
We chose to use Google Workspace to host our SecureComputer.ai email domain, for the sake of reliability and compatibility (and keeping things in the US). Google DOES have access to the content of any emails you send to the SecureComputer.ai domain, and Google will collect other data about you, which is true of any Gmail account.<br>
<br>
Calling or texting us with a regular phone service (not using Signal) should not be considered secure.<br>
<br>
Our communication methods are likely no less secure than the majority of businesses out there, we just want to be as transparent as possible. You should by default assume any method of communication is not secure, until you've verified otherwise.<br>
<br>
Advanced users may use our public key to encrypt emails: <a href="scs-public.key" download="scs-public.key">Download scs-public.key</a>. We will publish instructions, and perhaps software to make this task easier, in the future.<br>
